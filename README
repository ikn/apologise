Can't Even Apologise: a game about a person-thing who kills anyone that gets
near (he's cursed or something).

This was made for Ludum Dare 22, a 48-hour competition in December 2011.
Theme: alone.

This version has some minor post-competition changes: fixes for a couple of
exploits, jumps in level 5 less annoying, pausing, antialiasing the silhouetted
shapes, no jump/walking sounds when on a person-thing, and particles.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

./configure
./run

    PLAYING

It should be fairly obvious that when one of the other person-things moves
inside the big red circle around the character you control, they end up as a
solid immoveable block.  By being careful about where this happens, you can
reach other areas.

    CONTROLS

arrow keys, WASD: move.
R: reset the level.
enter, space: advance text.
escape, backspace: pause/unpause.

WASD works for other keyboard layouts too: QWERTZ, AZERTY, Dvorak, Colemak.

To quit, close the window.
